# AI-Based Projects: Text Summarization & Handwritten Digit Recognition 

This repository contains two deep learning projects:  

1️⃣ **Text Summarization using LSTM** (Natural Language Processing)  
2️⃣ **Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN** (Computer Vision)  

Both projects are implemented using **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on sample datasets.

## 📌 Project 1: Text Summarization using LSTM  

### 📝 **Overview**  
This project focuses on **text summarization** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**. The model is trained on sample AI-related text data and uses **tokenization and padding** to prepare input sequences.  

### 🚀 **Features**  
1. Implements **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
2. Uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks.  
3. Tokenizes input text and converts it into numerical sequences.  

### 🔧 **Installation**  
Make sure you have Python installed and run:  
```sh
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

### 📛 **How to Run**  
Run the script using:  
```sh
python Text_Summarization.py
```

### 🖼️ **Sample Output**  
After training, the model prints:  
```
Text summarization model training complete!
```

## 📌 Project 2: Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN  

### 📝 **Overview**  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits from `0` to `9` using the **MNIST dataset**. The model achieves **high accuracy** and can predict digits from unseen test data.  

### 🚀 **Features**  
1. Uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
2. Trained on the **MNIST dataset**.  
3. Achieves **97%+ accuracy**.  

### 🔧 **Installation**  
Make sure you have Python installed and run:  
```sh
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
```

### 📛 **How to Run**  
Run the script using:  
```sh
python handwritten_digit_recognition_model.py
```

### 📛 **Dataset**  
- The **MNIST dataset** contains **60,000 training images** and **10,000 testing images** of handwritten digits.  

### 🖼️ **Sample Output**  
After training, the model prints the accuracy:  
```
Test accuracy: [value]
```
It also visualizes a sample test image with the predicted label.
